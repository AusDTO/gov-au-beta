    %h2 What is GOV.AU Beta?
    .abstract
      %p
        GOV.AU Beta is a small imagining of what a whole-of-government platform
        could look like. Its goal is to make Australian Government information
        and services simpler, clearer and faster.
      %p
        We're designing GOV.AU in phases and this Beta version is a very early
        release. This means we can launch new features swiftly, speak to users
        regularly and get feedback as we go – helping us create the best
        possible experience for everyone.

    %h2 What’s available now?
    .abstract
      %p
        GOV.AU Beta includes some examples of user-focussed information and
        services content that we’ve grouped into categories.
      %p
        We’ve also worked on some
        =link_to "agency ‘corporate’ content", departments_path
        and
        =link_to "minister pages.", ministers_path

    %h2 What’s coming next?
    %p.abstract
      We have plans to expand our information and services content. This will
      involve pulling in content from multiple government agencies to focus on
      what users need to know about a particular topic.
