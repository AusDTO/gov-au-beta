    %h2 What's new in Beta
    %p.abstract
      We're designing this site in phases. This allows us to launch new features faster than releasing a completely redesigned GOV.AU. Some links are inactive as we're hard at work on new features and content. Our focus has been on department content, topic content and one life event.
